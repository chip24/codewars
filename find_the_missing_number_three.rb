# This is the final solution that worked.  It was basically my original solution, but I just added the last line to reject any permutations that were not the length of the missing number of elements. One of the top (and only) answers on Codewars is below.  It's a lot shorter than mine.

# def find_number(a,b,s)
#  l = [*a..b].join.chars.tally.merge(s.chars.tally){|_,x,y| x-y}.sort.map{|k,v| k*v}.join
#  (a..b).filter{|x| x.to_s.chars.sort.join == l}
#end

def find_number(n)
  p [start, stop, string]
  
  # create hashes of the counts of all of the digits in the full range and string
  range_hash = (start..stop).to_a.join.chars.sort.tally
  string_hash = string.chars.sort.tally
  
  missing_elements = []
  # iterate over both hashes and find the elements that are missing from the string.
  # add the missing elements to the missing_elements hash
  range_hash.each do |element, count|
    if string_hash[element].nil? || string_hash[element] < count
      (count - string_hash[element].to_i).times { missing_elements << element}
    end
  end
  # find all permutations of the missing elements
  p missing_int_arr = missing_elements.permutation.to_a.map {|arr| arr.join.to_i}.uniq.reject {|num| num < start || num > stop}
  # reject any permutations that are not the length of the missing_elements array
  final_arr = missing_int_arr.reject {|int| int.digits.count != missing_elements.length}
end
