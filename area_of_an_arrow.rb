# For some reason my code was ranked 25 out of 107 even though it was extremely simple.  The top code was "a * b / 4.0".  I only needed help getting the equation to find the area of the arrow.

def arrow_area(a, b)
  ((a * 0.5) * (b * 0.5))
end

p arrow_area(4,2)
p arrow_area(7,6)
p arrow_area(25,25)
