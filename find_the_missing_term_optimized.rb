#ChapGPT optimized my original code.  You have to find the length of the complete sequence by adding one to the length of the given sequence.  Then, you compute the expected sum using the arithmetic sequence formula, which is n(n+1)/2 where n is the complete sequence length. Finally subtract the complete sum from the given sequence sum to find the missing value.

#the top Codewars answer just combined the steps like this: 
#def find_missing(a)
#  return (a.min + a.max) * (a.size + 1) / 2 - a.sum
#end

def find_missing(sequence)
  n = sequence.length + 1  # As there is one number missing in the sequence
  expected_sum = n * (sequence.first + sequence.last) / 2
  actual_sum = sequence.sum
  
  expected_sum - actual_sum
end

# Test cases
p find_missing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11])
p find_missing([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9])
p find_missing([1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
